I've tried to make the installation procedure as painless as possible, if it doesn't work there is either something wrong with your automake 
packages or you haven't installed Boost >= 1.52.0 properly.

To build, simply run:

$> ./autogen.sh


The build process will automatically clean up any leftover object files and files that automake generated.

Your binaries will be placed into the "bin" directory if you run the autogen script, otherwise issuing "make $foo" will drop the built 
target binary into your current working directory.

Remember that a 'make distclean' or 'make clean' will not remove any binaries installed by the autogen script, those are placed into the "bin" 
directory and you can simply empty it out if you want to build another release.


PLEASE DO NOT make any changes to the automake configuration without getting prior approval from Yamamushi, or else God have mercy on your 
soul.
