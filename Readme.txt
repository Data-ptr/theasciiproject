The overall aim of "The ASCII Project" is to develop a Unicode graphics based 
"Roguelike" MMORPG engine which operates a persistent world driven by a 
player-run economy.



NEWS
=====

    10/07/2012 - The project is currently undergoing a major reorganization. 
    
        Old code is available in the "archive" branch, however please keep in
        mind that it has no little to no reflection on the current direction
        of the engine code for "The ASCII Project". I hope to get everything 
        back up and running within the next week or two.



GOALS
=====

	* Players can "destroy" and place blocks and items to create persistent 
    structures, in much the same way that Minecraft allows players to work 
    together to build constructions.

	* The game world will run and operate independent of player-input. NPC's 
    will continue to develop and operate when nobody is logged into the 
    server.

	* The game world will operate in a 3-Dimensional space, allowing for an 
    "advanced" physics engine and opening the door to new possibilities.

	* NPC's will operate independent of eachother, in that each has the 
    ability to make their own decisions based on their relationships with 
    players and other NPC's.

	* The above mentioned relationships will continue to develop amongst 
    NPC's with out any player input.

    * All C++ source code will remain 100% C++11 compliant, including 3rd 
    party libraries. If changes are necessary to those libraries to remain 
    standards compliant, they will be made where possible. Otherwise we 
    will defer to another library or write our own if necessary.

	* TBA - I would rather be coding that writing up this readme file, 
    please refer to the homepage at http://www.theasciiproject.com and the 
    wiki at http://www.theasciiproject.com/wk/ for more information.



NOTES
=====

    * Various documents of interest are located in docs/, and licenses 
    where necessary have been included in licenses/. If you are new 
    to this project and are just trying to figure out what this is all 
    about, please refer to docs/ABOUT.txt

    * The largest online repository of information about this project can 
    be found on our wiki at http://www.theasciiproject.com/wk/ , some of 
    it may be dated as of the time of writing this document, however it 
    does house the most consolidated collections of ideas and goals for 
    this project.
