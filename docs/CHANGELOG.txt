==================================

0.0.0f
Okay so this was enough of a change that I felt like moving the version number
up to 0e :)

I have created a 100% complete bitmap font.png for this project, and I guess
for the "World" to use. The ones I dug up online, and even from the libtcod
forums weren't 100% complete and it took me a heck of a time to find out there
was a "ttf2png" tool on the interwebs.

I've tested and implemented the font pack into the project, and it can be seen
if you compile and run the client ("make all" for those of you too lazy to
read the install file in this directory).

I'm excited about this change, as it opens the door to finally tackle Tile
issues and moving on to bringing "life" into the client :)





0.0.0e(rev2)
A minor update to change where classes are organized.





0.0.0e(rev1)
Actually there aren't many large changes in this push.

I have started using NetBeans as an IDE because of it's portability and minimal
interference. Because of this, you will notice that there is now a directory
labeled "nbproject" in the project files.

I believe, however don't quote me on this, that this will allow people to import
this project into netbeans with minimal effort.

Until next changelog update,

0.0.0e
Cleaned up quite a lot with this push, finally settled on a coloring system that
was wasy to manage and was fairly portable.

From here I'll add a few more features to entities and the entity map that
allows for entities that exist on different map layers to populate a single
entity map.





0.0.0d
Cleaning more things up, finally settled on a base framework for entity
placement and management.

There is an issue with entity colors not being passed properly, or with the
rendering engine, I haven't figured out which is responsible but it is a glaring
bug that will need to be addressed before I continue.





0.0.0c
FOV is working! At least in basic terms, it's not clean but it certainly works
for now!

I got caught up for several hours on computing it properly all because I
couldn't bother to read some documention properly.

Next up, likely more cleanup and organization before we continue, but we're
slowly getting there!





0.0.0b
More improvements on the room generator - halls now auto generate.

Bounds checking has been broken up into pieces - Map object still has a function
to see if a point is in a valid spot however.




0.0.0a

Basic room generator written. It will create a group of rooms that don't
intersect, and put the player in one of them.

Bounds checking in place, but will be moved elsewhere as it does not belong in a
Map object.




0.0.0

Basic game engine, VERY basic game engine. Slowly making fixes and modifications
with long term development in mind.
