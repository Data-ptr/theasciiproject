0.0.0d
Cleaning more things up, finally settled on a base framework for entity placement and
	management.
There is an issue with entity colors not being passed properly, or with the rendering engine,
	I haven't figured out which is responsible but it is a glaring bug that
	will need to be addressed before I continue.




0.0.0c
FOV is working! At least in basic terms, it's not clean but it certainly works for now!
I got caught up for several hours on computing it properly all because I couldn't bother to read some
	documention properly.
Next up, likely more cleanup and organization before we continue, but we're slowly getting there!





0.0.0b
More improvements on the room generator - halls now auto generate.
Bounds checking has been broken up into pieces -
	Map object still has a function to see if a point is in a valid spot however.



0.0.0a

Basic room generator written. It will create a group of rooms that don't intersect, and put the player in one of them.
Bounds checking in place, but will be moved elsewhere as it does not belong in a Map object.




0.0.0

Basic game engine, VERY basic game engine. Slowly making fixes and modifications with long term development in mind.
