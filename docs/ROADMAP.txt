The ASCII Project
=================

- Our first overall project goal is to get a basic game engine running, 
which does not involve networking. There will be basic creature combat, 
an inventory, savegames, movement, etc.

- Once we have a few basic steps in place, we're going to look into 
moving over to another graphics library. We may end up moving everything 
over to an ncurses base, but that has yet to be determined.

- Our second overall project goal is to get a basic game engine running 
involving networking. Players will be able to connect to a server 
address, interact with eachother and logout while saving their character 
information on the server.

- TBA
