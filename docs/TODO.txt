07/06/2012 TODO List:

Cleanup code, organize things a little better.

Add a graphics library and move related functions into it.

    - Begin the long task of removing reliance on foreign
	libraries for graphics handling. IE, nothing should
	absolutely rely on graphics output for runtime.

    - This will also solve the question on how I was going to
	store the colormap away from everything for the time being. 










07/05/2012 TODO List:

finish our drawing functions for hallways between rooms :)

More Cleanup

Add some more useful functions that come to mind to our Map and Entity classes.

Create a coreutils set of functions.

After I feel confident with these things, I'll be moving on up.







07/03/2012 TODO List:

Consolidate coloring tiles into a function called 
"void initColors()"


While we're at it, we can also create 
"void setColor(entity *target, TCODColor foreinit)"
