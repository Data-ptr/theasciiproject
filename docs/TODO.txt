07/11/2012 TODO List:

Tile Symbols - The first part of this involves changing our text
        output mode to Unicode. Afterwards I'm going to implement
        a way for Tiles to change their symbols depending on the
        orientation of tiles around them.

        This is going to take a few days to fully implement, so there
        won't be a TODO update until that has been smoothed out.








07/08/2012 TODO List:

More Code cleanup - I really should have thought about some
	of these things before I started piecing things
	together.

Change how colors are rendered and stored within entities and,
	tiles. The goal is for each entity and tile to store
	this information in a way that will allow them to be
	more independent of external libraries.

I need to cleanup the entities map, and possibly re-think (ugh)
	how that information is stored and passed between
	entities. Doing this now will make it easier to
	conceptualize a 3d environment, and for entities
	to be aware of what exists around them in 3d dimensions.





07/06/2012 TODO List:

Cleanup code, organize things a little better.

Add a graphics library and move related functions into it.

    - Begin the long task of removing reliance on foreign
	libraries for graphics handling. IE, nothing should
	absolutely rely on graphics output for runtime.

    - This will also solve the question on how I was going to
	store the colormap away from everything for the time being.










07/05/2012 TODO List:

finish our drawing functions for hallways between rooms :)

More Cleanup

Add some more useful functions that come to mind to our Map and Entity classes.

Create a coreutils set of functions.

After I feel confident with these things, I'll be moving on up.







07/03/2012 TODO List:

Consolidate coloring tiles into a function called
"void initColors()"


While we're at it, we can also create
"void setColor(entity *target, TCODColor foreinit)"
