!!!NOTE!!!

You MUST have libtcod 1.5.1 Bitbucket version installed for this program
to compile and work properly.

You can find it at:
https://bitbucket.org/jice/libtcod

Older versions will not work due to bugs with the unicode output encoding,
so if you're using a pre-compiled libtcod from a zip/tar file on the
libtcod homepage, you will not get the proper output from the client here.



** Linux Users **

If you want to install libtcod as a shared library in /usr/lib/ , that will
make things easier as there are no plans to distribute the libtcod.so
and libtcodcxx.so linux libraries with this project at this time.
Otherwise you can stick the libtcod.so and libtcodxx.so files in
this directory to build this project properly.



** OSX Users *

Compiling libtcod was rather painful on my OSX machine,
so I've included the required *.dylib files under
the "osx/" directory.

You can copy these over to /usr/lib/ and you should be
good to go, assuming that you have the other dependencies
for libtcod installed already.

You'll have to visit the libtcod website referenced above
for more information on what those dependencies are. Mainly
you're going to want to get libSDL installed.

The SDL library can be found over at
http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php .



** IMPORTANT **

Because I know someone out there isn't going to read this,
there are different makefiles for different OS's included in
the "makefiles/" directory.

Copy one of those files that corresponds to your OS into the
main directory as "Makefile" and run "make".

Once you have a built binary, you can run it with "./client"
