!!!NOTE!!!

You MUST have libtcod 1.5.1 Bitbucket version installed for this program
to compile and work properly. You can try to use one of the precompiled 
library binaries in the folder that suits your architecture, or you can
try building a fresh libtcod library from source -

You can find it at:
https://bitbucket.org/jice/libtcod

Older versions will not work due to bugs with the unicode output encoding,
so if you're using a pre-compiled libtcod from a zip/tar file on the
libtcod homepage, you will not get the proper output from the client here.



** Linux Users **

The shared libraries for libtcod have been included in the "linux" directory.
These were compiled against x86_64, so there's no guarantee that they will
work on your Linux installation. In addition, there are libtcod depdencies
you may be missing, however you should refer to the libtcod documentation 
for further information on them.

I believe, however don't quote me on this, they are:
zlib
zlib-devel
libpng
libpng-devel
SDL
SDL-devel


** OSX Users *

Compiling libtcod was rather painful on my OSX machine,
so I've included the required *.dylib files under
the "osx/" directory.

You can copy these over to /usr/lib/ and you should be
good to go, assuming that you have the other dependencies
for libtcod installed already.

You'll have to visit the libtcod website referenced above
for more information on what those dependencies are. Mainly
you're going to want to get libSDL installed.

The SDL library can be found over at
http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php .



** Windows Users **

There are dll's available in the "windows" foloder, however I make no
guarantees as to whether or not they will work for you.



** IMPORTANT **

Because I know someone out there isn't going to read this,
there are different makefiles for different OS's included in
the "makefiles/" directory.

Copy one of those files that corresponds to your OS into the
main directory as "Makefile" and run "make".

Once you have a built binary, you can run it with "./client"
