I've had to make a few changes to the C++ Sockets library in order to get it to compile properly using -stdlib=libc++ or -std=c++11 .

I'm including the full source code for the library here for the time being, as it is still GPL covered. As soon as I finish up a few odds and ends, I'll pull in Boost Libraries that will eliminate the need for things like the C++ Sockets Library.
