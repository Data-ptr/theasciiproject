<p>The overall aim of "The ASCII Project" is to develop a Unicode graphics based "Roguelike" MMORPG engine which operates a persistent world driven by a player-run economy.</p>

<h1>GOALS</h1>

<pre><code>* Players can "destroy" and place blocks and items to create persistent structures, in much the same way that Minecraft allows players to work together to build constructions.

* The game world will run and operate independent of player-input. NPC's will continue to develop and operate when nobody is logged into the server.

* The game world will operate in a 3-Dimensional space, allowing for an "advanced" physics engine and opening the door to new possibilities.

* NPC's will operate independent of eachother, in that each has the ability to make their own decisions based on their relationships with players and other NPC's.

* The above mentioned relationships will continue to develop amongst NPC's without any player input.

* All C++ source code will remain 100% C++11 compliant, including 3rd party libraries. If changes are necessary to those libraries to remain standards compliant, they will be made where possible. Otherwise we will defer to another library or write our own if necessary.

* TBA - I would rather be coding that writing up this readme file, please refer to the homepage at http://www.theasciiproject.com and the wiki at http://www.theasciiproject.com/wk/ for more information.
